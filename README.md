This project is divided in 4 parts :

## First part     
Given the position of a tree(longitude,latitude), it finds the name of the city where the tree exists, the name of the closest route to the tree, as well as the names of the 2 other routes (if they exist) that serve as boundaries to the tree.

### Usage
Put the list of positions of trees in the variable inputs and run the program.
```python
inputs = 'put here the list of positions'
```

## Second part

It takes the positions of several trees and gives not only the name of city, the road where they are found and the names of the 2 other routes (if they exist) that serve as boundaries to the trees but also the order in which they will be found on the road.

### Usage
Put the list of positions of trees in the variable inputs and run the program.
```python
inputs = 'put here the list of positions'
```

## Third part
With the Latitudes and Longitudes of 2 trees that are in the same route it finds the name of city and neighbourhood shared by the trees, as well as the names of the 2 routes (if they exist) that serve as boundaries to both trees.

### Usage
Put the list of positions of 2 trees in the variable inputs and run the program.
```python
inputs = ' put here the list of positions '
```

## Fourth part
With the Latitudes and Longitudes of several trees that are in the same route it finds the name of city and neighbourhood shared by the trees, as well as the names of the 2 routes (if they exist) that serve as boundaries to both trees.

### Usage
Put the list of positions of the trees in the variable inputs and run the program.
```python
inputs = ' put here the list of positions '
```
